ABSTRACT In many instances, freight vehicles exchange load or
information with plants that are or will soon be Industry4.0 plants. The
Wagon4.0 concept, as developed in close cooperation with e.g. port or
mine operations, offers a maximum in railway operational efficiency
while providing strong business cases already in the respective plant
interaction.

The Wagon4.0 consists of main components, a power supply, data network,
sensors, actuators and an operating system, the so called WagonOS. The
Wagon OS is implemented in a granular, self-sufficient manner, to allow
basic features such as WiFi-Mesh and train christening in remote areas
without network connection. Furthermore, the granularity of the
operating system allows to extend the familiar app concept to freight
rail rolling stock, making it possible to use specialised actuators for
certain applications, e.g. an electrical parking brake or an auxiliary
drive. In order to facilitate migration to the Wagon4.0 for existing
fleets, a migration concept featuring five levels of technical
adaptation was developed.

The present paper investigates the benefits of Wagon4.0-implementations
for the particular challenges of heavy haul operations by focusing on
train christening, ep-assisted braking, autonomous last mile and
traction boost operation as well as improved maintenance schedules.
